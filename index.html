                    will

                <h1>Vission</h1>
                <p>As I've learned from working with my coaches, reflection is one of the most powerful tools for
                    learning
                    and moving forward. Reflection doesn't mean dwelling on mistakes or getting nostalgic about happy
                    memories. Reflection is a set period of time we give ourselves to consider our experiences, the
                    actions
                    we took, the results, what we learned, and what we will do differently as a result. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="half-expo">

                <h1>Goals</h1>
                <p>Every day we have too many decisions to make. Each decision drains our energy. If your goals are not
                    top-of-mind these decisions are more difficult. Preventing us from doing anything. If your goals are
                    clear, decision fatigue is reduced and your choices become easier. Easier, not easy </p>

                        <p>As a leader in the field, you may already be doing these things. If youâ€™re not, try them. If
                            you
                            are, consider how you could share these steps with staff on your team. Help them grow their
                            professional networks.</p>
